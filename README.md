# Esports’ Debut as a Medal Event at 2023 Asian Games: Exploring Public Perceptions with BERTopic and GPT-4 Topic Fine-Tuning
This study examined the impact of esports at the 2023 Asian Games on the opinions of esports stakeholders using an LLM-enhanced BERTopic modeling analysis. We identified five major themes representing stakeholder perceptions within and beyond the esports ecosystem. Key findings highlighted the strategic use of social media marketing to influence public opinion and promote esports events and brands, emphasizing the importance of event logistics and infrastructure. Additionally, the study revealed the co-creation value contributed by stakeholders outside the esports ecosystem, particularly in promoting national representation and performance. Our findings supported the ongoing efforts to legitimize esports as a sport, noting that mainstream recognition remains a challenge. The inclusion of esports as a medal event showcased broader acceptance and helped mitigate negative public perceptions. Moreover, contributions from non-traditional stakeholders underscored the value of cross-subcultural collaborations in esports.
